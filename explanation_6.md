Approach
Here I went for the straightforward approach to traverse the array once and keep tabs on the min and max value. 
I'm not sure this is the intended solution, though. 
There might be a slighty more effective approach using divide & conquer that requires fewer comparisons, but I could not find it.

Efficiency
With one array traversal, the time complexity is O(n). 
The space complexity here is again O(n) due to the input array. 
The algorithm only uses a few fixed auxiliary variables.
