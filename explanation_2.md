Analysis:
Time Complexity:
The time complexity is O(log(n)). Refer Design Choices section.

Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(log(n)). The input_list gets split into 2.

Design Choices:
I chose to do a binary search splitting each list into left and right halves until finding the number provided as an input.
